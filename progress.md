# ðŸŒŸ Day 1 - Python Basics

A collection of basic Python functions demonstrating core programming concepts, developed in Jupyter Notebook.

### Environment Setup

- **Python**: 3.13.3
- **Anaconda**: 24.11.2
- **IDE**: VS Code with Jupyter Notebook
- **Tools**:
  - Git for version control
  - GitHub for repository hosting
  - Conda for environment management

## Project Contents

### Basic Python Functions

- Variable and Data Types
- Conditional statements
- Looping structures
- List, tuples, dictionary

### My Workflow

1. First, I created a repository on my github account and cloned the empty repository onto my local computer.
2. I installed python 3.13.3, anaconda 24.11.2. With the help of anaconda prompt shell, I opened the file of my repository with the help of Jupyter notebook.
3. I wrote my code on my notebook created and the code was simultaneously saved in my local system.
4. At last, I committed all the changes to my github repository using git commands - add, commit, push.

### âœ¨ Learning Outcomes

- Environment configuration (VS Code + Anaconda + Jupyter)
- Git workflow (`clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`)
- Python syntax fundamentals
- Notebook-based development
My key learnings were -
1. How to use jupyter notebook through anaconda and write python codes on it.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-basics.git
   ```
