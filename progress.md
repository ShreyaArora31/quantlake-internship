# ðŸŒŸ Internship Daily Progress 

## Day 1 - Python Basics - 16th June

A collection of basic Python functions demonstrating core programming concepts, developed in Jupyter Notebook.

### Environment Setup:

- **Python**: 3.13.3
- **Anaconda**: 24.11.2
- **IDE**: VS Code with Jupyter Notebook
- **Tools**:
  - Git for version control
  - GitHub for repository hosting
  - Anaconda for environment management

### Basic Python Functions

- Variable and Data Types
- Conditional statements
- Looping structures
- List, tuples, dictionary

### My Workflow

1. **Repo Setup:** Firstly, I made a new folder on my local computer in order to open the project through VS Code. Then, I created a repository named quantlake-internship on my github account and cloned the empty repository onto my local computer folder.
2. **Environment Setup:** I installed python 3.13.3, anaconda 24.11.2. With the help of anaconda prompt shell, I opened the file of my repository on Jupyter notebook.
3. **Notebook Completion:** I wrote my code on my notebook which I created and the code was simultaneously saving in my local system.
4. **Git and GitHub:** At last, I committed all the changes to my github repository using git commands - add, commit, push with the help of VS Code.

### Learning Outcomes

My key learnings were -
1. How to use jupyter notebook through anaconda, open local folders, create notebooks and write python codes on it.
2. How to use Markdowns in notebooks.
3. Practiced Python fundamentals.
4. Set up a working Python environment.
5. Successfully structured and initialized my internship repository.
